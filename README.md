Springboard Capstone 2 Project
Problem statement formation 
Can I create a model that will predict whether Lending Club borrower will default on loan payments with 75% success by June?
Context 
On Kaggle: Lending Club is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market.
Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers and origination fee and investors a service fee.
Criteria for success 
Model will predict 75% of loans will default on payments by June. 
Scope of solution space 
The focus will be on whether an applicant will or will not default on the loan. I will not look at whether all payments will be on time. 
Constraints 
Non-verified fields will have to be taken as truth. If the applicant was not truthful in any of the fields, it will impact the model effectiveness.
Stakeholders 
Lending Club investors
