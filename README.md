## Context

Lending Club is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market.

Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers and origination fee and investors a service fee.

There is inherent risk in lending money. Will the lender be paid back or will the borrower default on the loan? It would be useful to have a model that can predict loan defaults. In this project I will create a model to predict which loans will default. 

## Criteria for Success

Model will predict whether a Lending Club borrower will default on loan payments with 75% accuracy
